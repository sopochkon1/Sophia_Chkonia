<p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">I recieved my BS in Biology from University of California, Los Angeles, in 2020, and started my MPH in Columbia in 2021.</p>

<p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">I am interested in Global Health, emerging infectious disease, infectious disease control, data science in public health, and have found a new interest in building websites!</p> 

<p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">I also like sailing, hiking, and traveling to new places!</p>

<p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px"> This website contains my resume, my Github, a sample dashboard, my contact information, and my P8105 final project, which ended up in the top 5 projects of the semester (observe below the cow sticker we received as a reward)</p>


<p style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">fun fact about me: Even though I was born in the United States, I grew up in Georgia (the country).</p>
